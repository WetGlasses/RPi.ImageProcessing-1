# RPi.ImageProcessing-1

At first, some basic image processing is done. I have used OpenCV and numpy library. This code can detect a blue ball in front of a different colored background. But, as i have used only the blue layer matrix of the RGB image in the processing, this gives negative result in front of a white background. (As bright white color has a intense blue color value)
